Hi, I’m @HenrikDueholm

I'm CLA and I've been working with LabVIEW since 2011. 
The earlist version I've worked on was LabVIEW 6, but I've spent most of my time in the four digit versions.


I’m interested in classes, actors, PPLs, re-use and the development workflow.


I’m currently working on build automation.


If you find any of my projects interesting or want to collaborate on something feel free to reach out to me (henrikdue) at yahoo.dk mail.
